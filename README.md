# Learning Vue.js at W3 Schools

With the *W3 Schools Vue.js* course I have been able to get a general overview of the framework and learn the basics of it.

This repository was made for testing Vue.js while I was first studying it.

## Featured

With my study and the exercises, I have gotten to learn:
- To build **SPA** (Single Page Application) with Vue.js SFC (Single-File Components);
- To make client-side routing with **Vue Routing** library;
- To use **Axios library** for HTTP requesting;
- To use **Lifecycle Hooks**.

> As it is only a testing repository, it was not intended to be well-organized or clean-coded.
